1. Divide and Conquer Algorithm
2. Worst Case Time : O(n^2)
3. Despite O(n^2) worst case, it is considered factor, beacuse of the following reason.
    a. In-Pace
    b. Cache Friefndly
    c. Average case in O(nlogn)
    d. Tail reverse
4. Patition in kg function(Naive(Stable), lumato, Hoare)
